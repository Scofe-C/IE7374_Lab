# IE7374 Lab Submissions

| Lab | Description |
|-----|-------------|
| **Lab 1 — GitHub Actions** | Automated CI workflows: Lab 1 fetches the Iris dataset on every push; Lab 2 runs a daily scheduled quality gate that fails the build if RandomForest accuracy drops below 95% and writes a Markdown report to the job summary |
| **Lab 2 — Airflow** | A 4-task Airflow DAG (`load_data → preprocess_data → train_model → evaluate_model`) running in Docker that trains a RandomForest on Iris and logs a full classification report; tasks communicate via XCom pickle |
| **Lab 3 — Data Labeling** | Three-part Snorkel weak supervision series on phishing email detection: Lab 1 builds labeling functions, Lab 2 applies data augmentation, Lab 3 uses slicing functions to monitor and improve per-subgroup model performance |
| **Lab 4 — GCP** | *(in progress)* |
